# MCP vs n8n

## What You Wanted:
- Connect your AI to tools
- Keep it private
- Automate workflows

## n8n Way:
- Self-host n8n server
- Configure workflows in GUI
- Maintain infrastructure
- Secure webhooks
- Keep it updated
- ~500MB+ footprint

## MCP Way:
- Install npm packages
- Drop config file in LLM
- Done
- ~50MB total

## When You'd Actually Need n8n:
- Complex multi-step workflows with branching logic
- Need to connect 10+ different services
- Visual workflow debugging is critical
- You're building something for non-technical users

## For Your Use Case (AI + tools):
MCP is literally designed for this. n8n is overkill.

## You Can Always Add n8n Later
Start with MCP. If you hit a wall, then add n8n.
Don't start with complexity you don't need yet.
