# Why This Exists: MCP vs n8n (Deep Dive)

You were about to set up n8n to connect your AI to tools. Let's talk about why MCP is usually a better first step.

## Two-sentence summary

- MCP gives your AI direct access to local tools during a conversation (interactive, local-first).
- n8n orchestrates services into automated workflows that run on schedules or triggers (automation, server-based).

## Setup Process — Side by Side

### MCP Setup
Time: ~10–30 minutes  
Requirements: Node.js/npm (for many servers), edit a JSON config, restart AI

Example:
```
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
# edit AI config to point to mcp-server-filesystem and folder path
# restart AI
```

### n8n Setup
Time: ~2–4 hours (initial), more if production-grade  
Requirements: Docker, database (optional but recommended), reverse proxy (optional), ports open

Example:
```
docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8nio/n8n
# configure via web UI; add credentials for each service
```

## Maintenance Comparison

MCP:
- Mostly low maintenance. Update servers when needed.
- Fixes: restart AI, correct config typos.

n8n:
- Requires container management, DB care, credential rotation.
- Fixes: debug workflows, check node logs, manage webhooks and scaling.

## Time Investment Comparison

| Phase | MCP | n8n |
|---|---:|---:|
| Initial setup | 10–30 minutes | 2–4 hours |
| Learning curve | Low (read one config) | Medium (UI, nodes, triggers) |
| Production hardening | Light | Significant (DB, backups, reverse proxy) |

---

## Common Tasks Comparison

| Task | MCP | n8n |
|---|---:|
| Read a local file | ✅ (AI calls filesystem server) | ⚠️ (requires workflow and file node) |
| Call an API interactively | ✅ | ✅ |
| Scheduled job (cron) | ❌ (not core) | ✅ |
| Webhook receiver | ❌ | ✅ |
| Complex multi-service automation | ⚠️ (possible but manual) | ✅ |
| Local privacy-first workflows | ✅ | ⚠️ (more exposure) |

## When you actually need n8n

- You need robust scheduled or event-driven automation (cron/webhook).
- You need visual workflow building for non-technical users.
- You are integrating many 3rd-party services in production.

## When MCP is better

- You want interactive, local-first AI tooling during chats.
- You want a super-fast setup and fewer moving parts.
- Your daily need is tool access, not full automation.

## Specific recommendation for your use case

You're privacy-focused, new to GitHub, and learning via ChatGPT. Start with MCP. Install a few servers (filesystem, fetch, github), experiment via chat. If you later find yourself saying "I want this to run every night automatically" or "I want to expose a webhook to GitHub," consider moving that specific automation into n8n. Not everything needs a workflow manager — sometimes a single server and a config file is enough.

## Final note

MCP is intentionally minimal: it reduces friction and encourages iteration. n8n is powerful but heavier. Try the simple path first — you can always add complexity later.

If you're still reading this instead of trying the 10-minute test... run `./servers/install-essentials.sh` and prove me wrong.
