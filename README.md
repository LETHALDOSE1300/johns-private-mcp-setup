# MCP Starter Kit: Your Simpler Alternative to n8n

> For Sid: Welcome to GitHub! Only took you a year of coding to get here. Better late than never.

## What the Hell is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a way to give your AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, or local LLMs) direct access to tools and data. Think of it as a USB port for your AI—you plug in "servers" (tools) and suddenly your AI can read files, call APIs, browse the web, manage Docker containers, and more.

**The simple version:** Instead of copy-pasting between your AI chat and your terminal 500 times a day, MCP lets your AI do the work directly.

## Why This Exists (And Why You Don't Need n8n Yet)

You were thinking about using n8n to connect your AI to tools. That's like buying a semi-truck when you need to move a couch. Here's the reality:

| Task | n8n | MCP |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Setup Time** | 2-4 hours | 10 minutes |
| **Maintenance** | Weekly updates, Docker containers, workflow debugging | Basically none |
| **Complexity** | Visual workflow builder, webhooks, API keys everywhere | JSON config file |
| **Privacy** | Self-hosted but complex | Everything runs locally |
| **Best For** | Complex multi-step automations, scheduled tasks, integrating 50+ services | Giving your AI direct tool access |

**Bottom line:** Start with MCP. If you find yourself thinking "I need to trigger 15 different APIs based on a schedule and send the results to 3 different places," *then* look at n8n.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes, I Promise)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/LETHALDOSE1300/johns-private-mcp-setup.git
cd johns-private-mcp-setup

# 2. Install essential MCP servers
chmod +x servers/install-essentials.sh
./servers/install-essentials.sh

# 3. Configure your AI (Claude Desktop, Ollama, etc.)
# Copy the appropriate config from config/ folder
# Instructions in config/README.md

# 4. Restart your AI application

# 5. Try it out!
# Open your AI and say: "List the files in my home directory"
```

**That's it.** If it worked, your AI just read your filesystem. Welcome to MCP.

## What's Included

### Essential Servers (Start Here)
- **filesystem** - Read/write files, search directories
- **fetch** - Call APIs, get web content
- **github** - Manage repos, issues, PRs
- **sequential-thinking** - Better reasoning for complex tasks

### Advanced Servers (Add When Needed)
- **puppeteer** - Browser automation, web scraping
- **docker** - Container management
- **memory** - Persistent memory across conversations
- **commands** - Run terminal commands (powerful, use carefully)

## Start Here Instructions

1. **Read ACTUALLY_READ_THIS.md** - 10-minute hands-on test
2. **Run the essentials installer** - Get the core servers
3. **Configure your AI** - Copy config, customize paths
4. **Test in the sandbox** - Make sure everything works
5. **Try the examples** - Learn patterns you can reuse
6. **Build something** - Now you're dangerous

## Why This Repo Exists

You're a privacy-focused developer who's been coding for a year, just discovered GitHub last week, and you're currently learning everything via ChatGPT. You were about to set up n8n to connect your AI to tools, which is like using a flamethrower to light a candle.

This repo is an intervention. MCP is simpler, more private, and exactly what you need right now. Later, when you're actually building complex multi-service workflows, we can talk about n8n.

## What's Next?

- ACTUALLY_READ_THIS.md — Your actual starting point
- WHY_THIS_EXISTS.md — Deep comparison if you're still not convinced
- sandbox/ — Test everything in a safe environment
- examples/ — Real patterns you can copy
- troubleshooting/ — When things inevitably break

P.S. Welcome to GitHub! You're going to fit right in. Now stop overthinking and just run the installer.
